As a tester your main job will be verifying that feature is working as expected
    * actual result (comes from UI/backend app) VS expected (documentation/user story/dev team) result

    ***** use sometimes if you are stuck with which answer is right or wrong
      USE DEPENDS

WebElements: everything on a webpage,
            1st step Locate the element: findElement() method -- locator string as a parameter
            2nd step : we apply action-- click(), sendKeys(), getText(), get ...many different things

  8 locators in Selenium-- 6 of them already defiened in the HTML part: id,name,className, tagname, linkText/paritalLinkText
  2 other: Custom locators
  xpath: 2 category- absolute xpath (top to bottom every tags up to that element)
                   - relative xpath : has special syntax
                        //tagName[@attribute='value']
                        //tagName[.='text'] : with text
                        //tagName[contains(@attribute,'value')] : attribute + partialText

  CSS: has cleaner syntax, some automation tools(cypress) only using CSS
        tagName[attribute='value']
        if there is ID or class: short expressions
        tagName#id
        tagName.className

  TestNG provides annotations to run your project in a certain way you want
  @Test :
  @BeforeMethod or @AfterMethod : runs before/after each @Test
  @BeforeClass or @AfterClass

  Assertions come with TestNG
  Assert.assertTrue(condition,message)
  Assert.assertEqual(actual,expected,message)

  Utility Classes and Methods:
  * We have general utility class and methods such as WebDriverFactory
  * We have also project level and oriented utilities
