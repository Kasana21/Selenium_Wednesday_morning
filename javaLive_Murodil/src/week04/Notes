If statements

Control flow statements

    code that allows you to control how your program runs

single if statement:

    if (boolean expression) {
        //code to run if condition is TRUE
    }

        when the boolean expression is true -> the statements inside of the if block will be executed

        when the boolean expression if false -> nothing will happen, the code will resume
        execution after the if statement    when we write if statement, else is block is not mandatory.

A
if(B){
  C
}
D
--------------
1) B is true: A, C, D
2) B is false: A, D

===================================


if else statements

    if(boolean expression) {
        //code to run if condition is TRUE
    } else {
        //code to run if condition is FALSE
    }

        when the boolean expression is true -> the statements inside of the if block will be executed

        when the boolean expression is false -> the statements inside of the else block will be executed
--------------
int pay;
if(condition) {
    pay = 2000;
} else {
    pay = 3000;
}
pritnln(pay);

1) condition is true: 2000
2) condition is false: 3000
-----------------

A
if(B){
  C
  D
}else {
   E
}
F
----------
1) B is true: A, C, D, F
2) B is false: A, E, F
--------------

a and b
if a is greater b: "a is greater"
if b is greater than a : "b is greater"
otherwise : they are equal

a = 10, b = 3, c = 1
    a is largest
    is a greater than b AND is a greater than c
    if(a > b && a > c)
a = 10, b = 30, c = 1
    if(b > a && b > c)
    b is largest
a = 10, b = 30, c = 100
    c is largest

multi branch
    whenever there is multiple conditions that are related we can use the multi-branch if to handle them

    execution for multi branch: the first condition is checked, if it true the first block is executed, otherwise(false) it will check the next condition.

        if(boolean 1){
            // statements that get executed when the boolean 1 is TRUE
        } else if(boolean 2) {
            // statements that get executed when the boolean 2 is TRUE
        } else if(boolean 3){
            // statements that get executed when the boolean 3 is TRUE
        } else {
            // statements that get executed when all the other boolean conditions were FALSE
        }

    Note: you can declare as many else if blocks as needed
    Note: you can add else at the end, it is optional
    Note: once a condition is true and its code block is executed the other conditions are NOT checked
    Note: multi branch statements are used to make the code more efficient and more readable

single if vs if else vs multi branch

    single if: checks one condition and if its true run some code

    if else: checks one condition and if is true runs some code, but also has some code to run if its false

    multi branch: checks multiple conditions and define different blocks of code to run whenever one of the conditions is true
--------------------------------

__________________________________________________________________

if without brackets

    if statements can be created without brackets, but this limits the if statement

    If without brackets will execute only the next line after it

    Take away: always use brackets

int num = 4;

if (num > 0)
    println("positive");
else if (num < 0)
    println("negative");
else
    println("zero");
__________________________________________________________________

Nested If statements

    if statement inside of another if statement

    if( 1 ){

        if( 2 ){
            A
        } else {
            B
        }

    } else {

        if( 3 ){
            C
        } else {
            D
        }

    }

     1,     2,      3
    true,  true,   true -> A
    true,  false,  true -> B
    false, true,   true -> C
    false, true,   false -> D

    Treat each statement as a separate statement where each boolean condition is checked one at a time
_______________________________________________________________switch

Conditional statement: controlling the flow of execution

    switch statements compares only exact values
        ==
        relational operations > < are not allow in switch

    switch(input value){
        case x:
            // statements
            break;
    }

    switch: keyword that is used to create switch statements

    input value: value that is checked in the switch
        can only be: byte, short, int, String, char, enum
        what is not allowed: boolean, float, double, long

    case: value that you are looking for
        Ex: if the input value was num an int variable the case could be:
            case 5:  <--> if(num == 5)
            case 6:  <--> if(num == 6)

        case should match the same datatype as the input value
        cases should be unique


1 -> customer care, 2 -> tech support,  3 -> sales

int input = 1;

if (input == 1) {
    println("You reached customer care");
} else if (input == 2) {
    println("You reached tech support");
} else if (input == 3) {
    println("You reached sales");
} else {
    println("invalid, try again");
}

====Switch can be used:
Old switch syntax:

int input = 1;

switch (input) {
    case 1:
       println("You reached customer care");
       break;
    case 2:
       println("You reached tech support");
       break;
    case 3:
       println("You reached sales");
       break;
    default:
        println("invalid, try again");
        break;
}

Enhanced switch syntax:


int input = 1;

switch (input) {
    case 1 -> println("You reached customer care");
    case 2 -> println("You reached tech support");
    case 3 -> println("You reached sales");
    default ->
        println("invalid, try again");
}

    statements: any code that should run when a case matches

    break: exits the switch statement

    default: the case that gets executed if no other case matches

Flow of execution

    if: check one boolean at a time, if it true run the that block, but if its false check the next condition

    switch: matches the case right away then runs the statements defined from that point until the end of the switch statement
        Note: we use break to also stop the switch

Benefit: more readable, compact, easy to maintain, in general can be quicker in execution than if statement

else: code block that runs when all other boolean in the if statements was false
default: the case the runs when no other case matches

__________________________________________________________________

ternary

    different way to write an if statement

    returnValue = boolean_expression ? trueValue : falseValue;

        ? if
        : else

    int n1 = 44;
    int n2 = 33;
    int max;
    if (n1 > n2) {
        max = n1;
    } else {
        max = n2;
    }
    println(max); 44

    ------------------
    int n1 = 1;
    int n2 = 3;
    int max = (n1 > n2) ? n1 : n2;

    println(max); 3

DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself

If statement vs Switch vs Ternary

    in most cases you will use if statements
    any switch or ternary can always be converted to an if statement
    If statements allow more flexibility by using single if, if else, multi branch, or nested

    Switch is useful to compare the exact value, so it is a good choice when all the possible values are known (they will be the cases)
    Downsides: only compare values, no boolean logic, and the datatypes that can be compared are a little restrictive

    Ternary useful sometimes to make a quick single if statement in one line
    Can only be used when a value is returned, and you need to at least define two possible outputs
