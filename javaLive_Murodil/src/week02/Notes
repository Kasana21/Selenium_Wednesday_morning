print statements

	System.out.println();
	-> lets you output something to console

	Difference between print and println
		System.out.println() -> output to the console and the break the line
		System.out.print()	 -> output to the console in the same line. It DOESN't break the line

comments

	Comments are text in a program file that will not be executed. The compiler ignores these lines

	commenting is a good practice to describe how the code works.

	They serve as documentation and help others understand how the code works

	- Comment types

		Single line comment: in a single line with two forward slashes
			// this is a single line comment

		Multi line comment: can be used to group many lines as a comment with opening /* and closing */

			/*
				comment line 1
				comment line 2
				comment line 3
			*/

		Java doc comment: similar to multi line comments, but provides more features for HTML documentation. Starts with /** and closes with */

			/**
			*	comment line 1
			*	comment line 2
			*	comment line 3
			*/

		TODO:
			// TODO: study more comment

			The TODO text is detected in a comment and IntelliJ can detect the TODO items.

			Look at the bottom left for the todo tab or
			view -> tool windows -> todo

escape sequence

	Q: How can you output this:
			I like "java" programming

			System.out.println("I like "java" programming"); <-- ERROR

	We can use the backslash to define a character we want to output
		-> this is useful when the character we want to output is also part of java syntax

		\

		for example: if we want to output a " quotation mark we can do:
			\"

			"java" -> \"java\"
			System.out.println("I like \"java\" programming");

		for example: if we want to output a \ backslash we can do:
			\\

            The first backslash is for the syntax of escape characters
            The second backslash is for the backslash character to be output

		some more useful escape characters:

			code 	-> output
			\" 		-> "
			\\ 		-> \
			\'		-> '
			\n 		-> new line
			\t 		-> tab

__________________________________________________________________

variables

	container to hold data/information
	allows us to use that information multiple times
		re-usability

		DRY: Don't repeat yourself

	- Declare a variable: makes a container/variable ready to be used

		dataType variableName;
		int age;

	- Assign a value to a variable: store some value/number into your container

		variableName = value;
		age = 10;

			 = equals sign is the assignment operator

	- Declaring and assigning at the same time

		dataType variableName = value;
		int age = 10;

	- multiple variables declaration in 1 statement:

			int apples, grapes, bananas, mangoes;
			apples = 10;
			grapes = 3;
			bananas = 23;
			mangoes = 55;

	- Using/Printing variables
		To use a variable's value we use just the variable name

			ex: int students = 200;
				System.out.println(students); // this will print 200
				System.out.println("students"); // this will print "student" as text
				System.out.println(STUDENTS); // this will give an error because
				// STUDENTS variable does not exist

				String students = "100";

	-  reassigning
		changing the value something else, old value is lost. Updating the variable

	- Hardcoded: directly in the code, so it is difficult to change

__________________________________________________________________

datatypes

	Primitive datatypes: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char

	Object types: (we will spend more time on this later)
		-> String

	-> all primitives are lowercase

		whole numbers: (ex: 40)
			byte
			short
			int   <- by default
			long
		floating numbers: (ex: 24.62)
			float
			double  <- by default
		characters: a single character, uses ''
			char
		boolean: true or false
			boolean

	-> compiler uses int and double by default

	How to tell the compiler you want long number: use an 'L' at the end of the number
	How to tell the compiler you want float number: use an 'F' at the end of the number

	------------------------------------------------------------

    char : holds a single character
    	-> each character is represented in a single quote 'a'

        char ch = 'B';
        char lastLetterOfMyName = 'z';
        char last = 100;

		Q: how does the computer know we want a certain character
			There is character sets that associate characters to a number

			ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
      			is one character set that is used for english
      			it is part of the unicode character set which handles many languages and characters


     var can be used with variables to set data type automatically based on value:
     var num = 44; num variable is set as int
     var price = 123.45; price is set as double variable
     var gender = 'M'; gender variable is char

     var can be used as a shortcut for variable data type.

	------------------------------------------------------------

	String: sequence of characters in double quotations
		object type

	String name = "Alice";
	String lastName = "Smith";
	String group = "Batch39";

    	Q: What is the difference between 'a' and "a"

			the types are different. The 'a' is a char type and the "a" is a String type

			object types take more memory

naming conventions

	convention: what everyone follows

	Example: today is sunday

	project/folder: today-is-sunday

	package: lowercase, use underscore for multiple words (snake case)

		ex: today_is_sunday

	classes: first letter is uppercase and the rest lowercase, for each word
		Pascal Case: Every word starts with an uppercase

		ex: TodayIsSunday

	variables: camel case
		-> first word is lowercase, then any following words start with an uppercase

		ex: todayIsSunday

variable naming rules

	- make the variable names are clear as possible
		dont do:
			int x;
			int a;

	- We cannot use reserved keywords, which are already used by Java as a programming language.
	public, static, package, void, for, if, etc.

	https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html

	- Variables can contains these:
		- any letter (A-Z, or a-z)
		- any number (0-9)
				Cannot start with numbers, but it can contain numbers.
					Ex:
						1stWord -> INVALID
						word2 -> VALID

		- only special characters allowed are dollar sign $ and underscore _
				but it is not encouraged.

				int _$ = 55;
				_1Number
__________________________________________________________________

	Q: Can you write whole numbers starting with 0?
		no, it becomes a different number

	Q: What about var?
		it is added more recently, so not always used. It can be limiting for other topics, so use the above datatypes

	Q: is this a valid variable
		int Public = 40;
			yes in terms of syntax it is correct because the lowercase p, public is a keyword
__________________________________________________________________

Concatenation

	concatenation operator +

		concatenation: combining text with any data, returns String
		concatenation turns everything to a String

	String name = "Bob";
	int age = 32;

	println(name + " is " + age + " years old");
	=> Bob is 32 years old

Casting primitives:

We can convert from one type of primitive to another using casting.

1) Implicit casting, from small type to large/Widening. Automatic:

byte b1 = 10;
short sh1 = b1; //casting from small to large.

2) Explicit casting, from large to small.Narrowing. Manually

int apples = 65;
byte pears = (byte)apples;

double price = 433.44;
int wholePrice = (int)price; //433
